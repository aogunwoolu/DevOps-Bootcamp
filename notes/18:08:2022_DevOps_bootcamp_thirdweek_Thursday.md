## agile fundamentals

**positives**: 

1. productivity improved
2. quality improved
3. changes in requirements 

**negatives**:

1. estimations hard to make
2. feature creep may be present
3. organisational culture change
4. not for all projects

there are **11** key elements to SCRUM (agile)

Stakeholders:

- investor
- government
- user
- client

the time to market is the most important in terms of requirement creation

first agile environments **RAD**:

- **R**apid **A**pplication **D**evelopment
- focuses on speed ontop of everything else

essence of agile:

- embrace change
- iterative
- empirical
- incremental
- Self organised teams
- empowered 
- learn fast
- feedback

Waterfall:

- heavily delated ___gated___ process
- more than 50 sprints, it will be closer to waterfall
- static backlog, deliverables aren't changing

**MVP**: minimum viable product, learning platform for testing and evaluate solutions

- is your digital service worthwhile
- giving one/two features at a time allows them to test better

<u>come to value</u>

agile values the people/team > processes and tools

__working__ software > comprehensive documenttion

customer collaboration > contract negotiation

responding to change > following a plan

<u>**12 Agile Principles**</u>

1. highest priority is to satisfy customer through early and conitnous delivery of valuable software
2. welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for customer's competitive advantage
3. Deliver working software frequently, from couple weeks to months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
4. business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5. build projects motivated individuals. Give them environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done
6. most effiecient and effective method of conveying information to and wirgin a development team is fact to face conversation
7. working software is the primary measure of progress
8. agile processes promote sustainable development. Maintain constant pace
9. continuous attention to technical exellence and good design enhances agility
10. simplicity (maximise the amount of work not done) is essential
11. the best architectures, reuirements & designs emerge
12. at regular intervals, team reflects on how to become more effective & tunes behaviour

**three pillars of empirical process control**:

1. Transparency 
2. Inspection
3. Adaptation 

best team size: 5 - 9 (**preferably 6**)

**turning the ship around**, David Marquet: leadership

## Scrum Framework

1. Product backlog
   - ordered by value
   - reflecting true priorities of customer
2. spring backlog
   - product team select a few items from the backlog
3. work in sprint (24 hours/2-4 weeks)
   - Potentially shippable product increment

**Scrum Elements:**

1. **Events**:
   - ___sprint___
     - time-boxed period of software development
     - **Fixed** and agreed by team members 
       - don't stay overtime
     - one calendar month or less
   - ___Sprint planning meeting___
     - end of meeting, everyone does confidence vote
       - rating from 1 - 10 about the plan's deliverability 
     - for scrum team to plan sprint delivery
     - timeboxed to 8 hours for 1 month sprint
       - split into 2x 4 hours: What & How
   - ___sprint review meeting___
     - event is for
       - product owner
       - scrum master
       - Development team
       - additional stakeholders
     - **show** don't tell
     - elicits feedback
     - backlog refinement
       - what does the feedback do to the backlog **!! Important step !!**
       - if you do not refine the bcklog, this is not agile
   - ___sprint retrospective___
     - reflect on performance as a team
     - anything should stop
     - anything should start
   - ___daily scrum___
     - event is for the developers
       - Testers
       - Designers
       - Programmers
       - etc...
     - 15 minutes every day
     - planning the day
     - answers 3 questions:
       1. what did i do yesterday
       2. what am i planning to do today
       3. what impediments are stopping me completing my task
     - 3 questions may become boring, good scrum master will pick tickets and ask questions about them
     - for planning
2. **Artifacts**:
   - product backlog
   - Sprint backlog
   - increment
3. **Roles**:
   - ___scrum master___
     - someone who is good at scrum
     - not a manager, a coach & facilitator 
     - removes impediments
   - ___product owner/voice of the customer___
     - Goals:
       - developing & explicitly communicating product goals
         - vision for 3 - 6 months in the future
       - creating & communicating product backlog items
       - ordering product backlog
       - make transparent, understandable & visible product backlog
     - business focused
     - is the face for scrum team
   - ___developer___
     - Types:
       - Testers
       - Designers
       - Programmers
       - etc...
     - responsibilities:
       - create plan for sprint
     - instill quality
       - adheres to "definition of done"
       - Organisation creates this "definition of done":
         - everything must be unit tested
       - dev team can be added to but not taken away from
     - adapting their plan each day toward the sprint goal
     - holding each other accountable
     - Self-organising
     - when lacking skills, **bringing someone else in** vs **training a member in a team**
4. **Values**:
   - courage
   - focus
   - commitment
   - respect
   - openness
